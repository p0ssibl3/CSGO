As players return from a several month long hiatus from tournament play, they have immediately jumped into action this week at DreamHack Masters Marseille 2018. Three players have truly demonstrated excellence in both their individual and team performance during the group stages in Marseille.

In light of Stewie2k's departure from the Cloud9 roster and the arrival of North American IGL FNS, DreamHack Marseille is the first opportunity for Cloud9 to demonstrate whether they still have the firepower to compete with current top rosters in Faze Clan and Astralis. They certainly made a statement as they surprisingly beat Faze Clan in a best of 3 2-0. Uncharacteristically, Rush stood out as the star player to step up and excel in the absence of Stewie2k. It seems that Stewie2k's departure has freed up Rush and allowed him to return to his favorite positions and playstyle. During the group stages, Rush consitently got effective entry kills and really locked down A site on mirage.

Astralis is another team that people had doubts about the viability of its roster and whether they would ever rise back to its previous prime. The addition of Magisk has clearly revitalized the team as he effectively played his passive-aggresive nature to best benefit his team. Astralis convincingly won against another top tier one team in Liquid with two of three maps leading to a landslide victory. Magisk constantly held sites and often times led to early advantages on Astralis's CT side.

Of course we end on the best player in CS:GO, simple. He has continued his master class performances in Marseille as he is currently top rated in the tournament and led to convincing bo3 victories with Navi topping their group. It'll be exciting to see if simple can lead Navi to a tournament victory as they enter playoffs.
